# Book-Manager
A book inventory app.

## About
This app is the result of my studies using CoreData. It is a simple app, only to check how can I use CoreData the best way possible.

## Features
* List of all books that were added previously by the user
* Add a book to the inventory
* Delete a book from the inventory.
* Edit some information of a single book from the inventory.
* Nest books of the same author in the same section.
* Search of books by name and/or author. (TODO)
