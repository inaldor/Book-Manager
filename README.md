# Book-Manager
A book inventory app.

## About
This app is the result of my studies using CoreData and SQLite. It is a simple app, only to check how can I use CoreData and SQLite in the same environment.

## Features
* Add a book to the inventory
* List of all books that were added previously by the user
* Delete a book from the inventory. (TODO)
* Edit some information of a single book from the inventory. (TODO)
* Search of books by name and/or author. (TODO)
